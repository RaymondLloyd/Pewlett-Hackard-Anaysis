# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview:
Pewlett-Hackard is looking for employees that are close to retiring so “retirement packages” can be offered based on certain criteria. They would also to know which positions will need to be filled when those employees do retire. We will be discovering who will be retiring and how many positions need to be filled by usin PostgreSQL.

##  Results:

In our first deliverable, we created a “Retirement Table” that holds all the titles of current employees that were born from the start of 1952 to the end of 1955. By manipulating our data and functions, we were able to create the “Retirement Table” that holds the number of retirement age employees by their most recent job “title”.
